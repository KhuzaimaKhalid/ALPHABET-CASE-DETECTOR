# ALPHABET-CASE-DETECTOR
This C program determines whether a character entered by the user is in uppercase or lowercase. It prompts the user to input a single character and checks its ASCII value to classify it accordingly.

Features
Detects if the entered character is uppercase (A-Z) or lowercase (a-z).
Displays the ASCII value of the entered character.
Provides feedback for invalid inputs (non-alphabet characters).
How It Works
The program starts by displaying a title message.
It prompts the user to enter a character.
It reads the character input using scanf.
The program checks the ASCII value of the character:
If the character is between 'A' and 'Z', it is classified as uppercase.
If the character is between 'a' and 'z', it is classified as lowercase.
If the character is not an alphabet, it prompts the user to enter a valid alphabet.
The program outputs the classification and the ASCII value of the character.
